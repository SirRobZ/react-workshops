# A Step-By-Step Walkthrough Of Redux Data Flow

In this session we are going to first cover some basics fof redux and after that we will be more focused
on setting up `redux-thunk` and creating advanced asynchronous actions based on that.  
It is also worth noting that in the next session of this workshop series we will also cover other known
redux middlewares like
[Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga)
and
[Redux-Observable (which is based on RxJS)](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable)

## Note:
Please let me know if you are interested in covering another React related topics or if you think we better spend more on a specific topic.
