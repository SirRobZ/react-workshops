# Universal React with Next.js - React on the Server

We are going to first talk about the concept of __Universal JavaScript__, then
we'll discuss how to use __`React`__ to implement a Universal App and eventually
we'll set up a Universal React Application using [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js).

## Note:
Please let me know if you are interested in covering another React related topics
or if you think we better spend more on a specific topic.
