# Universal or Isomorphic

Ever since Airbnb developers popularized the term Isomorphic JavaScript people have been confused
about what exactly it means to have an **Isomorphic JavaScript** application and what it takes to build one.
Eventually **Michael Jackson** (the React guy) suggested the term **Universal JavaScript**
and most people seem to prefer it and proclaim **“Isomorphic”** to be dead.

## Note:
As it is obvious there are two different mindsets when we want to discuss thee two terms: **Universal** and **Isomorphic**.
1. One approach is that **Isomorphic JavaScript** and **Universal JavaScript** are the same but the **Universal JavaScript** makes more sense.
2. The other approach is **Isomorphism and Universal JavaScript are two different things**.

Lets dig into the differences between these two approaches.
