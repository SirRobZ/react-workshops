# Universal is a better term for Isomorphic JavaScript

**Isomorphic JavaScript** has been first sugested by Charlie Robbins at his article: [Isomorphic JavaScript: The Future of Web Apps](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/isomorphic-javascript-the-future-of-web-apps-10882b7a2ebc)

__Robbins__ explains that what he meant by **Isomorphic JavaScript** was:
> that any given line of code (with notable exceptions) can execute both on the client and the server

![Isomorphic](https://github.com/jsmentor/react-workshops/raw/master/04-universal-react-with-next-js/isomorphic.png "Isomorphic")

However, if we examine more closely the meaning of the word isomorphic we read:
> corresponding or similar in form and relations

In other words, two entities that are not the same but only look the same.
This would be a great word to use when describing the relationship between __jQuery__ and __Zepto__
or __Underscore__ and __lodash__, for example.
These libraries are similar in form (they share the same API) but _differ in underlying ideas and philosophy_.

Instead, what we need is a word that describes the **same code but running in a different environment**.

![Universal](https://github.com/jsmentor/react-workshops/raw/master/04-universal-react-with-next-js/universal.png "Universal")

when we use the word **Universal** instead of **Isomorphic** everyone gets it.
It may have something to do with **Apple** using that word: **[Universal Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_binary)**
to describe **application bundles** that ran on both architectures back when they made the switch from **PowerPC** to **Intel**.
