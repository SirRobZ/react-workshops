# Basics of RxJS Observables

For this session we are going to cover RxJS basics all in live-cosing and that's why there is no specific note for it.

## Resources I have used for this session:

It is worth noting that most of my RxJS Observable examples in this workshop comes from a great rxjs crash course:
[RxJS Observables Crash Course](https://youtu.be/ei7FsoXKPl0) which is highly recommended to watch
and if you have the time and want to master RxJS you could take its actual course: [Learn ReactiveX From The Ground Up](https://www.eduonix.com/affiliates/id/16-10436)
