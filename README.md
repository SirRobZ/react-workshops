## 1. A Step-By-Step Walkthrough Of Redux Data Flow

Redux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow and in this workshop we are going to use redux-thunk to walk you through the step by step of the data flow.

## 2. Understanding the React Component State and Lifecycle

React components have several "Lifecycle Methods" that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. We will cover every single step of the lifecycle by debugging and live coding. We will also cover how state works in every step.

## 3. Middlewares And React Redux Life Cycle

Middlewares are functions that are automatically called by the framework(Redux in our case) somewhere in the middle of the supposed control flow to enhance or change the output, before the end of the control flow.
