# Middlewares And React Redux Life Cycle

Middlewares are functions that are automatically called by the framework(Redux in our case) somewhere in the middle of the supposed control flow to enhance or change the output, before the end of the control flow.

## Note:
Please let me know if you are interested in covering another React related topics
or if you think we better spend more on a specific topic.
