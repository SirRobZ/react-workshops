# Chain-of-responsibility pattern

In object-oriented design, the __Chain-of-responsibility pattern__ is a design pattern consisting of
a __source of command objects__ and a __series of processing objects__.
Each processing object __contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle_;
the rest are __passed to the next processing object__ in the __chain__.
A mechanism also exists for __adding new processing objects__ to the end of this chain.
