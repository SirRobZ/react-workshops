# What Is A Middleware

One of the most distinctive patterns in Node.js is definitely __middleware__.
Unfortunately it's also one of the most confusing for the inexperienced, especially for developers
coming from the __enterprise programming world__.

The reason for the disorientation is probably connected with the __meaning of the term middleware__.

## Middleware in the enterprise architecture
Middleware in the enterprise architecture represents the various software suites that help to
__abstract lower level mechanisms such as _OS APIs_, _network communications_, _memory management_, and so on__,
_allowing the developer to focus only on the business case of the application_.   
In this context, the term middleware recalls topics such as __CORBA__, __Enterprise Service Bus_, __Spring__,
__JBoss_.

## Middleware in its more generic meaning
Middleware in its more generic meaning can also define:
> any kind of software layer that acts like a glue between __lower level services__ and __the application__
 (_literally the software in the middle_).
